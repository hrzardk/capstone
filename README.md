# Setara - Bangkit 2024 Capstone Project

Setara (Sistem Rekomendasi Tenaga Kerja Inklusif) addresses workforce exclusion among individuals with disabilities in Indonesia, where only 2 in 5 are employed (BPS, 2023). This Android app uses machine learning to provide personalized job recommendations based on users' abilities, experiences, and locations. With cloud-based infrastructure and real-time job matching, Setara promotes inclusivity and accessibility in the workforce. Aligned with SDGs 8 and 10, it aims to reduce employment barriers, foster equality, and support Indonesia's goals of reducing unemployment and inequality (Kementerian PPN, 2023).

## Machine Learning Learning Path

### Steps to Generate the Job Recommendation Model

1. **Open Google Colaboratory Notebook.** 
- You can begin by opening a Google Colab notebook for this project. It will serve as your workspace for training and evaluating the job recommendation model. You can follow the notebook to implement the machine learning model using a deep neural network.
2. **Prepare and Upload the Dataset**
- Ensure you have the job_data.xlsx dataset containing the relevant features: Disability, Age Experience, City, and Job.
- Upload the dataset to your Colab environment for preprocessing and training the model.
3. **Data Preprocessing**
- Use One-Hot Encoding to preprocess the categorical features, such as Disability, Age, Experience, and City. This will allow the model to better understand and process the input data for job recommendations.
4. **Model Training**
- The model will be built using TensorFlow and Keras, leveraging a fully connected deep neural network. Train the model using the preprocessed dataset with the following key steps:
- Build the neural network architecture (e.g., with layers like Dense, Dropout).
- Compile the model using an optimizer like Adam and the categorical_crossentropy loss function.
- Train the model with the X_train and y_train sets, using validation data to monitor the model's performance.
5. **Save the Model**
- After the model has been successfully trained, convert it into TensorFlow Lite format (job_recommendation_model.tflite) for mobile deployment.

### Featured Technologies

1. **TensorFlow**
- The core open-source library used for developing and training machine learning models. TensorFlow provides robust tools and workflows to quickly build machine learning applications.
2. **TensorFlow Lite**
- TensorFlow Lite is an open-source deep learning framework optimized for on-device inference, ideal for deploying machine learning models on mobile devices.
3. **Keras**
- Keras is a high-level API, running on top of TensorFlow, that simplifies building and training deep learning models. It provides easy-to-use interfaces for implementing neuralÂ networks.

## Mobile Development Learning Path

### Key Features

1. **Home Page**
- Personalized Greeting: Displays a welcome message based on the user's email.
- "Explore Now" Button: Provides direct access to the Job Recommendations page, where users can explore jobs tailored to their needs.
- Easy Navigation: A bottom navigation bar allows users to switch between pages, such as Home, Settings, and Job Recommendations, quickly and efficiently.
2. **Job Recommendations**
- This feature offers personalized job recommendations based on the user's preferences, making it easier for users to find suitable job opportunities.
3. **Settings**
- The Settings page allows users to manage their preferences, including Information about the application, Notification settings, and Logout options.
4. **Intuitive Navigation**
- The application is designed with user-friendly navigation, ensuring seamless access to all features and pages.

### Featured Technologies

1. **Andriod Studio**
- The official integrated development environment (IDE) for Android development. Android Studio provides powerful tools for coding, testing, and debugging, ensuring an efficient development process.
2. **MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel)**
- A robust architectural pattern that separates UI logic from business logic. MVVM helps create maintainable, scalable, and testable codebases by organizing components into Models, Views, and ViewModels.
3. **Kotlin**
- A modern, concise, and type-safe programming language designed for building robust Android applications. Kotlin enhances developer productivity and is fully interoperable with Java.

### Library

1. **Glide**
- A fast and efficient image loading and caching library for Android. Glide simplifies the process of fetching, displaying, and caching images in applications.
2. **Retrofit**
- A type-safe HTTP client for Android and Java. Retrofit simplifies API integration by converting HTTP API responses into Kotlin or Java objects, making it easier to handle RESTful services.
3. **Room**
- A persistence library that provides an abstraction layer over SQLite. Room ensures seamless local data storage and retrieval with compile-time checks, reducing boilerplate code and potential errors.
